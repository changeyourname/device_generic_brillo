This folder contains tests for libmedia and stagefright on Brillo.

Example files:
  libmedia_playback.cpp:
    Demos playing audio on libmedia. The audio consists of a tone that is
    played.
  libmedia_record.cpp:
    Demos recording and then playing the captured audio back using libmedia.
  stagefright_playback.cpp:
    Demos playing a mp3 file using stagefright. The mp3 is decoded and then
    played. A similar approach can be used to play other file formats.
  stagefright_record.cpp:
    Demos recording audio and then playing it back using stagefright. It does
    not demo encoding audio. An example to encode audio using stagefright can be
    found in frameworks/av/cmds/stagefright/audioloop.cpp.

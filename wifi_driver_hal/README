This folder contains the abstraction library for device driver
setup in Brillo.  This abstraction provides three major pieces
of functionality:

  - Initial driver setup, for devices that are not ready at boot.
    This method will be called at boot time.

  - Selecting between AP mode and station mode.  This is guaranteed
    to be called only after inital driver setup.

  - The method above will return the device name of the WiFi hardware
    that was created to the caller.

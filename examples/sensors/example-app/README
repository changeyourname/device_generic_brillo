This folder contains example code for writing native apps that use Brillo
sensors. The sensors HAL implementation must exist on the device for the apps
in this folder to run successfully.

Example files:
  hal-example-app.cpp:
    An example app that uses the sensors HAL (defined in
    hardware/libhardware/include/sensors.h) directly. In the app, the list of
    sensors found on the device is printed. And if an accelerometer exists, the
    app will read the data and print it out.

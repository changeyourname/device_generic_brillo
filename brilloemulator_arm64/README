The main android emulator uses the goldfish/ranchu board, but that arm target
isn't in upstream, nor in the kernel we currently utilize.  Instead, we use
the Versatile Express board as our target in the kernel and qemu.  Hopefully
one day the goldfish/ranchu targets will get upstreamed.

This has some ramifications for us.  Namely, we do not have access to the qemu
helpers like the goldfish pipe.  That in turn means we access adb over a local
TCP forwarded port.

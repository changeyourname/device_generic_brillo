This folder contains the files for libsensor, which is the library that
implements NDK sensors interface (defined in frameworks/native/include/android).
The files "looper.cpp" and "sensor.cpp" are copied from
frameworks/base/native/android (a0bda386b03d3b403a6614f13f3093f633ee2607). We
made this fork in order to provide Brillo developers the NDK interface to
access sensors without pulling in large dependencies like libandroid. This
folder will be deleted once the cleanups for libandroid and its dependencies
are done so that we can have the NDK sensors interface without increasing
Brillo image sizes tremendously.
